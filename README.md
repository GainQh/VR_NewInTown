# Abstract
&emsp;&emsp;This application "English Café" is an immersive English cross-cultural communication scene roaming interactive application based on VR all-in-one machine. Through the VR simulation of the language environment of a foreign cafe, it creates an immersive environment to truly realize the cross-cultural integration and development of countries in the same global village with English as the medium, and is committed to providing users with a platform for practicing English in four aspects: listening, reading and writing, which is not boring and has creativity.

# 1. UI Design
&emsp;&emsp;Warm orange, which is similar to the colour scheme of the café, was used as the main colour during the design process. The UI of the whole application is systematic and structured, with a clear catalogue, rich content and detailed and logical jumping relationships.

# 2. Scene Design
&emsp;&emsp;The scenario designed is a medium-sized urban cafe, fully learnt about interior design and built. It is divided into two floors. Emphasis was placed on the social space on the ground floor, and the double height was used to create a diverse atmosphere. Emphasis is placed on natural lighting and open space, which is close to the design concept of a medium-sized urban cafe.

# 4. Development Platforms and Play
&emsp;&emsp;Based on Pico4 with Unity development. And the basic operation is as follows: the left handle moves the joystick to achieve movement, the right handle moves the joystick to achieve spatial instantaneous movement, and according to the screen prompt UI, the interaction is triggered by different buttons. The ray emitted from the handle interacts with the UI button on the TV on the first floor and jumps to the crossword game scene.

# 5. Function Realisation
&emsp;&emsp;It implements different ways of playing for the four aspects of listening, speaking, reading and writing in order to help users achieve the effect of English practice. The specific functions are as follows:
- Interact with computers, boards, and iPads in the scene to view their content, including English news, articles, proverbs, and more;
- Dialogue with NPCs. Based on the virtual character's questions, the player can practice speaking, simulating real dialogue scenarios;
- Listen in on the NPC discussion. Dialogues between avatars can be heard within a certain range, exercising the user's listening skills, while the user can also view the original text through the UI interface;
- Interesting ordering feature. Players can interact with waiters and order their favourite drinks or snacks;
